# pto.vmull

`pto.vmull` is part of the [SFU And DSA Instructions](../../sfu-and-dsa-ops.md) instruction set.

## Summary

Widening multiply with high/low results.

## Mechanism

`pto.vmull` is a specialized `pto.v*` operation. It exposes fused, widening, or domain-specific hardware behavior through one stable virtual mnemonic so the instruction set can be reasoned about at the ISA level.

## Syntax

```mlir
%low, %high = pto.vmull %lhs, %rhs, %mask : !pto.vreg<NxT>, !pto.vreg<NxT>, !pto.mask -> !pto.vreg<NxT>, !pto.vreg<NxT>
```

Documented A5 types or forms: `i32/u32 (native 32×32→64 widening multiply)`.

## Inputs

`%lhs` and `%rhs` are the source vectors and `%mask` selects
  active lanes.

## Expected Outputs

`%low` and `%high` expose the widened-product low/high parts.

## Side Effects

This operation has no architectural side effect beyond producing its SSA results. It does not implicitly reserve buffers, signal events, or establish memory fences unless the form says so.

## Constraints

The current documented A5 form is the native
  widening 32x32->64 integer multiply instruction set.

## Exceptions

- The verifier rejects illegal operand shapes, unsupported element types, and attribute combinations that are not valid for the selected instruction set or target profile.
- Any additional illegality stated in the constraints section is also part of the contract.

## Target-Profile Restrictions

- Documented A5 coverage: `i32/u32 (native 32×32→64 widening multiply)`.
- A5 is the most detailed concrete profile in the current manual; CPU simulation and A2/A3-class targets may support narrower subsets or emulate the behavior while preserving the visible PTO contract.
- Code that depends on an instruction-set-specific type list, distribution mode, or fused form should treat that dependency as target-profile-specific unless the PTO manual states cross-target portability explicitly.

## Performance

### Timing Disclosure

The timing sources currently used for PTO micro-instruction pages are `~/visa.txt` and `PTOAS/docs/vpto-spec.md` on the latest fetched `feature_vpto_backend` branch.
For `pto.vmull`, those public sources describe the instruction semantics, operand legality, and pipeline placement, but they do **not** publish a numeric latency or steady-state throughput.

| Metric | Status | Source Basis |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A5 latency | Not publicly published | `visa.txt`, `PTOAS/docs/vpto-spec.md` |
| Steady-state throughput | Not publicly published | `visa.txt`, `PTOAS/docs/vpto-spec.md` |

If software scheduling or performance modeling depends on the exact cost of `pto.vmull`, treat that cost as target-profile-specific and measure it on the concrete backend rather than inferring a manual constant.

## Examples

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++) {
    int64_t r = (int64_t)src0_i32[i] * (int64_t)src1_i32[i];
    dst_lo[i] = (int32_t)(r & 0xFFFFFFFF);
    dst_hi[i] = (int32_t)(r >> 32);
}
```

## Detailed Notes

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++) {
    int64_t r = (int64_t)src0_i32[i] * (int64_t)src1_i32[i];
    dst_lo[i] = (int32_t)(r & 0xFFFFFFFF);
    dst_hi[i] = (int32_t)(r >> 32);
}
```
